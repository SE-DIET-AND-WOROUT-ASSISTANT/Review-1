    <h1>Diets we offer</h1>
    <p>A diet is all that we consume in a day. And a balanced diet is a diet that contains an adequate quantity of the nutrients that we require in a day.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="diet-col">
            <h3> Vegan Diet</h3>
            <p>This diet is a form of a vegetarian diet as it eliminates meat and animal products. One of the primary effects of this diet is that it reduces the intake of cholesterol and saturated fat. It takes some planning, but if a vegan diet is rationed out properly, it can have many positive effects. Studies have proven that those who practice a vegan diet minimize their overall risk of coronary heart disease, obesity and high blood pressure. To compensate for a lack of meat, vegans must find a way to incorporate more sources of protein and vitamin B-12 into their diets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diet-col">
            <h3>Paleo Diet</h3>
            <p>This is a natural way of eating, one that almost abandons all intake of sugar. The only sugar in a Paleo diet comes from fruit. However, abandoning sugar is not the only stipulation. Processed foods and grains are also eliminated from the Paleo diet. The fewer number of carbohydrates in your system leads to a decreased amount of glucose. So your system will then begin to use fat as its fuel source. In a Paleo diet, dairy is also eliminated. So what can be eaten? A Paleo diet consists of fish, fowl, vegetables, fruits, nuts, oils, sweet potatoes, eggs and meat, so long as that meat is grass-fed and not grain-fed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diet-col">
            <h3>Raw Food Diet</h3>
            <p>This is a diet that places a premium on eating uncooked and unprocessed foods. The diet eliminates the intake of any foods that have been pasteurized or produced with any kind of synthetics or additives. The diet is intended to create a surge in energy, a decrease in inflammation, while also lowering the number of carcinogens in one’s diet.</p>

            <h3>High Protein Non-Vegetarian Diet</h3>
            <p>This is also a high protein diet that is popular mostly among non-vegetarians. High protein non vegetarian diet concentrates on popular form of meat with good and healthy source of protein in them. Though the high protein vegetarian ingredients can be included in the recipes that are prepared with high protein non vegetarian foods, seared, sautéed, baked forms of non-vegetarian meat is most popular.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diet-col">
            <h3>Diabetic Diet</h3>
            <p>Diabetic foods is much needed for people prone to lifestyle diabetes and for those who have diabetes due to family heredity. This diet mainly concentrates on low-no sugars and minimum calories per serving of food.Diabetic diet mainly consists of fresh, stir fried or cooked vegetables, a serving of millets and millet based porridges, little or no fruits (specifically which are low in sugars, like apples, guava, papaya), beans, legumes, flax seeds, Greek yogurt and fewer meats like chicken breasts and tuna.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diet-col">
            <h3>Low Fat Diet</h3>
            <p>Low fat diet is majorly needed by people who have borderline or high cholesterol levels in blood. We need to concentrate on getting the good cholesterol (HDL) in to mitigate the accumulative cholesterol (oats, garlic and cranberries) and keep a check on foods containing fats.</p>
